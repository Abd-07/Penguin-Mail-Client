# ***Penguin Mail*** is a **Python** based mail client which allows you to send emails

## **Project Description**

- This application as you already know, is a simple **Mail Client**
    - For now you can only send emails 
    - All data that you enter in this program is saved ONLY on your computer, because the database is local
    - To use it you will need a GMAIL account
    - ***Note : Penguin Mail is just a program which allows you to send emails from your GMAIL account, without using the GMAIL website or app***

- What I hope to implement
    - Make usernames unique 
    - Not allow 'None' as a username
    - The 'forgot username or password' feature
